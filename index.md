Welcome this in an example to showcase how gh pages can be used to easily build an organizational hub.

The current theme, relies on a simple documentation template that automatically sources the contents of the docs folder into the left side navigation.

For our purpose, we would probably have to look for a [more suitable theme](https://jekyllthemes.io) to allow linking to our repositories more easily. 

Despite that, it is still possible to showcase our point by commiting the markdown files in this repository or point to a repo with the same look an feel (see the button below)
